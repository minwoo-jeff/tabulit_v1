demographic information. If provided, contact information may be used for testimonials 

or to request additional feedback information. Users will be advised and given an 

opportunity to consent or opt-out of such uses. Anonymous survey information will be 

used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Tabulit
